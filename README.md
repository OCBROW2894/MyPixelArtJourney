# PIXEL ART
## My pixel Art Journey
- I don't have a drawing Tablet but I have passion that needs to be fulfilled <b><i>Animation and Game Dev </i></b>
- So This Repository shows my Pixel Art journey if you wish to look at it and maybe think of following the same path use the <b><i>README.md</i></b>, it will have all the explanation about each folder

### NOTE: I'll also include the resouces I used to reach where I will be

### 🔨 Tools 
I settled on <b><i>Aseprite</i></b> as it is the most mentioned in almost all the pixel art resources
You can use these to know which is best for you:-

### Can't pay for Asesprite Build it like I did
- I'm planning to buy the software later just to promote my fellow Software Developers
### ⚠️NOTE: This is not Pirating as you'll be following the Guides provided by the Developers themselves
